    <h1>Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
    <h4>On this website you will find all you need to know about my favorite hobby, mechanical keyboards!</h4>
    <p>There's a lot to know about mechanical keyboards. From simple things like switch type, all the way down to accuation force and custom built keyboards. I won't be going over absoultely everything but I will be providing external resources for further study. Now to get down to it:</p>
    <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
    <p>A mechanical keyboard according to Wikipedia is:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard">
        Each key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem. Switches come in three variants: linear with consistent resistance, tactile with a non-audible bump and clicky, a tactile with an audible click.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-3">3</a>] Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate. The shape of the stem varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.

        Mechanical keyboards also have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards, with an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-4">4</a>] per switch for Cherry MX switches, while switches from Razer have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-5">5</a>]
