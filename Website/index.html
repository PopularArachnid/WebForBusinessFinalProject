                <p>There's a lot to know about mechanical keyboards. From simple things like switch type, all the way down to accuation force and custom built keyboards. I won't be going over absoultely everything but I will be providing external resources for further study. Now to get down to it.</p>

                <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
                <p>A mechanical keyboard according to Wikipedia is:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard">
                    Each key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem. Switches come in three variants: linear with consistent resistance, tactile with a non-audible bump and clicky, a tactile with an audible click.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-3">3</a>] Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate. The shape of the stem varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.

                    Mechanical keyboards also have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards, with an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-4">4</a>] per switch for Cherry MX switches, while switches from Razer have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#cite_note-5">5</a>]
                </blockquote>
                <p>Simply put, it uses a mechanical switch to regester the key press, as opposed to membrane keyboards that use a plastic dome-type seperator. In a membrane keyboard the membrane regesters a keypress when the dome is pushed down against the circut board, thus completing the circut and regeresting the key press. A lot of people have only used membrane keyboards and don't know how a mech feels or why they would even want one.</p>



                <p><br /><br /> I personally find the mechanical keyboard to be a lot more appealing for a few reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Feel: I can feel when a key is regestered and not only that but it feels responsive even if I'm not using a tactile switch. Membrane keyboards feel super mushy to me now. </li>
                    <li>Sound: Personally I enjoy blue switches because they are tactile and have a click. A word of caution: if you work in an office enviorment your co-workers may start to despise you after a while. </li>
                    <li>Speed: Since you have tactile and or sound feedback the speed at which you can type is increased. Unlike a membrane keyboard, a mech definitavely lets you know when your key press has regestered.</li>
                    <li>Looks: Now this isn't important to a lot of people, but mech keyboards are highly customizable. You can buy the type of switches you prefer, get custom keycaps, and even build your own keyboard. The customization is rediculous.  </li>
                    <li>Community: There's actually a pretty big community for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, particularly on Reddit with a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">subreddit</a> dedicated to it, as well as an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/">independant market</a> selling not only used parts but artisanal caps as well. </li>
                </ol>
